# Typescript Problem Solved

1) What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
    Interface and Type are like two different characters Interface is the strict office boss you must follow the rules It only maintains the objects structure and keeps everything disciplined On the other hand Type is the chill guy where you can assign union tuple              primitive anything Type is more flexible but you cannot declare it again with the same name Simply put Interface is rigid Type is flexible

2) What is the use of the keyof keyword in TypeScript? Provide an example.
    keyof is a tool that holds all the keys of an object as a type It works like the key to a cupboard you can open only the drawers that actually exist In the same way with keyof you can use the objects keys as types and avoid using wrong keys

3) Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.
    These three special types in TypeScript are just like a family drama any is the grandfather boss you can assign anything unknown is the careful brother you must check before using it never is the impossible uncle he does nothing and represents situations that logically     can never happen

4) What is the use of enums in TypeScript? Provide an example of a numeric and string enum.
    Enum is a fixed value list once you create it you cannot change it A Numeric enum automatically assigns 0 1 2 A String enum requires you to assign values manually Just like fixed members of a gang the values of an enum are predetermined Using it wrongly can create          inconsistencies in the project

5) Provide an example of using union and intersection types in TypeScript.
    Union and Intersection describe two different type logics Union means the value can be any one of the possible types like choosing ketchup or mayonnaise one is enough Intersection means you must satisfy all conditions together like needing both ketchup and mayonnaise
    In simple words Union is flexible Intersection ensures the full combination
